Considered checking for a start-point branch in the named git-repo-urls.
This would help not git clone repos with large docker/ dirs (eg jars).
Not doing this because CircleCI build-times are pretty good without it
and it would be better to rewrite the Dockerfiles to do 'proper'
installs rather than baking the jar files which get progressively older
and older.

{
#local branches=$(git ls-remote --heads ${repo_url})
#if [[ "${branches}" =~ 'refs/heads/start-point' ]]; then
#  echo "using start-point branch"
#  git clone --quiet ${repo_url} --branch start-point --single-branch ${index}
#else
#  echo "using master branch"
#  git clone --quiet --depth 1 "${repo_url}" "${index}"
#fi
}
