Change script as follows:
$ build_cyber_dojo_start_points_image.sh \
     acme/my-start-points \
     --languages \
     https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/ruby-minitest.git \
     https://github.com/cyber-dojo-languages/python-pytest.git \
     --exercises \
     https://github.com/cyber-dojo/start-points-exercises.git \
     --custom \
     https://github.com/cyber-dojo/start-points-custom.git    \



You can drop the marker files.
Also drop the start_point_type.json files.
script has to process the --languages options.


readonly MY_NAME=$(basename "$0")
readonly IMAGE_NAME="${1}"
readonly REPO_NAMES="${*:2}"

readonly CONTEXT_DIR=$(mktemp -d /tmp/cyber-dojo-start-points.XXXXXXXXX)
cleanup() { rm -rf "${CONTEXT_DIR}" > /dev/null; }
trap cleanup EXIT
mkdir "{CONTEXT_DIR}/languages"
mkdir "{CONTEXT_DIR}/exercises"
mkdir "{CONTEXT_DIR}/custom"

declare type=""
declare index=0
for repo_name in $REPO_NAMES; do
    case "${repo_name}" in
    --languages)
      type=languages
      continue
      ;;
    --exercises)
      type=exercises
      continue
      ;;
    --custom)
      type=custom
      continue
      ;;
    esac
    if [ -z "${type}" ]; then
      error ...
    fi
    cd "${CONTEXT_DIR}/${type}"
    git clone --verbose --depth 1 "${repo_name}" ${index}
    cd ${index}
    declare sha
    sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
    echo "${index} ${sha} ${repo_name}" >> "${CONTEXT_DIR}/shas.txt"
    index=$((index + 1))
done


Everything should still work as before, but the source code
only needs a single level of Dir.globs...

--------------------------------------------------------

It may prove convenient (eg testing) to have an option
to select only one of the start-points inside the git-cloneable URLs.
Something like this...
```bash
$ build_cyber_dojo_start_points_image.sh \
    acme/my-start-points \
      https://github.com/cyber-dojo/start-points-languages.git \
        --only java-junit                                      \
      https://github.com/cyber-dojo/start-points-exercises.git \
      https://github.com/cyber-dojo/start-points-custom.git    \
        --only Tennis
```

Or would it be better if script allowed names of git-repo-URLs
to be passed via stdin?

Suppose someone like James creates a new start-points image
from start-points-base and there are only _custom_ start points.
Should this be allowed?
And simply drop the [default setup] button from the web server?

# starting moving commander's start-point checking code
# to check_all.rb (with tests).
