move commander's start-point checking code
   to check_all.rb (with tests).

----------------------------------------------------
main script could gather all the command line args
and only if all are ok should it go on to do the
git clones. At the moment you could have a long list
of --languages repos and then it fails because you end
with a single -custom URL (one hyphen instead of two)

----------------------------------------------------
Considered checking for a start-point branch in the named git-repo-urls.
This would help not git clone repos with large docker/ dirs (eg jars).
Not doing this because CircleCI build-times are pretty good without it
and it would be better to rewrite the Dockerfiles to do 'proper'
installs rather than baking the jar files which get prgressively older
and older.
