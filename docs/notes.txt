It may prove convenient (eg testing) to have an option
to select only one of the start-points inside the git-cloneable URLs.
Something like this...
```bash
$ build_cyber_dojo_start_points_image.sh \
    acme/my-start-points \
      https://github.com/cyber-dojo/start-points-languages.git \
        --only java-junit                                      \
      https://github.com/cyber-dojo/start-points-exercises.git \
      https://github.com/cyber-dojo/start-points-custom.git    \
        --only Tennis
```

Suppose someone like James creates a new start-points image
from start-points-base and there are only _custom_ start points.
Should this be allowed?
And simply drop the [default setup] button from the web server?
