main script needs to do a [docker pull] of the base image
before creating the image FROM it.
However, this [docker pull] cannot be allowed to happen
when you are running the tests after just doing a
[docker build] to create a _local_ base image!

How about checking for the presence of an env-var...
That would make parsing the command-line easier.
It its similar to the way I check for whether git/docker is installed.

The output from the [docker pull] needs to be piped to /dev/null
(partly so that the tests still pass).

Also, my plan is to create 3 separate images.
One for custom, one for exercises, one for languages.
Does this means there will be no default git-repo-urls?
I don't see why.
    ./script <image-name> --custom

If this uses default git-repo-urls this will git clone them.
Wouldn't it be simpler to just [docker pull] the image?
Yes. But that is an implementation detail!
From the user's point of view, there are still defaults.

Don't try to make current script to both 3 in 1 and separate 3.
Create new script.
Main problem it will have is the base image needs to pass
the type [custom/exercises/languages] to the rack server
so that it can expose the correct API...

Currently main script does...
docker image build \
      --quiet                    \
      --tag "${IMAGE_NAME}"      \
      "${CONTEXT_DIR}

docker build has option...
   --build-arg list

So
docker image build \
      --build-arg SERVER_TYPE=--custom  \
      --quiet                    \
      --tag "${IMAGE_NAME}"      \
      "${CONTEXT_DIR}

Get that being passed through as a first step...

Dockerfile has
CMD [ "./up.sh" ]
I think that will need to become
ARG SERVER_TYPE
ENV SERVER_TYPE=${SERVER_TYPE}
CMD [ "./up.sh" ]

Then SERVER_TYPE will be an env-var available inside rack_dispatcher.rb

class RackDispatcher
  def initialize(request)
    @request = request
    @starter = Starter.new
    @server_type = ENV['SERVER_TYPE']
    ...
  end

A new branch...?

Program cyber-dojo script to handle
  --custom=NAME
and look for NAME as volume OR image.
Then tell James et al to simply convert each volume to an image.
docker-compose.yml will obviously need updating...
