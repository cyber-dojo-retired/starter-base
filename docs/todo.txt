Add visible_filenames as required key in exercise's manifest.json
It must not be allowed to contain a file called cyber-dojo.sh
starter.rb will still just assume instructions file is present.
Update start-points-exercises repo accordingly.

Add check that each visible_filename (exercises and languages) is less
than the truncation limit (25K?) in the runner. (Later)

Refactor web and saver so web passes saver the
display_name and exercise_name and saver gets the manifest.json
file from SPB. SPB will merge the visible_files from both manifests.

Lastly, SPB will need to have a bit of new functionality to
pick one file from the exercise's manifest.json visible_filenames
which it returns to web when web is showing the exercises name+content.
Algorithm.
if there is a file called instructions use that.
if there is a file called readme.txt use that.
otherwise use the biggest file.
