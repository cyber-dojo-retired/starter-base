Add visible_filenames as required key in exercise's manifest.json
It must not be allowed to contain a file called cyber-dojo.sh
starter.rb will still just assume instructions file is present.
Update start-points-exercises repo accordingly (done)
This is not a breaking change for commander since it will
ignore an exercise's manifest.json file (it just gets the instructions file)

in SPB, add check that each visible_filename (exercises and languages) is less
than the truncation limit (25K?) in the runner. (Later)

SPB will need to have a bit of new functionality to
pick one file from the exercise's manifest.json visible_filenames
which it returns to web when web is showing the exercises name+content.
Algorithm.
if there is a file called instructions use that.
if there is a file called readme.txt use that.
otherwise use the biggest file.

Refactor web and saver so web passes saver the
display_name and exercise_name and saver gets the manifest.json
file from SPB. SPB will merge the visible_files from both manifests.
THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE FOR commander because we will be
changing the behaviour of web. Do later. Once commander switched.

I could write a blog post on what to do to prepare for this
upcoming change...
o) add manifest.json file for each exercise
o) ensure you are (currently) creating your
   exercise start-points (volumes) using the --git option.
   But note that the URL can be a local url (file://....)
   ?Also give instructions on how to create a git repo in
   a dir:
     $ cd dir
     $ git init
     $ git add .
     $ git config --global user.email "EMAIL"
     $ git config --global user.name "NAME"
     $ git commit -m "initial commit"
