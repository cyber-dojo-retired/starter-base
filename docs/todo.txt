in SPB, add check that each visible_filename (exercises and languages) is less
than the truncation limit (25K?) in the runner. (Later)

Write a blog post on what to do to prepare for this upcoming change...
o) say these changes do not break existing behaviour.
   for a while old and new behaviours will live side by side.
o) ensure you are (currently) creating your
   exercise start-points (volumes) using the --git or --list
   options and not the --dir option.
   But note that the URL can be a local url (file://....)
   ?Also give instructions on how to create a git repo in
   a dir:
     $ cd dir
     $ git init
     $ git add .
     $ git config --global user.email "EMAIL"
     $ git config --global user.name "NAME"
     $ git commit -m "initial commit"
o) add manifest.json file for each exercise with "display_name" key
   and "visible_filenames" array.
o) use the new build-cd-sp script to create your own start-points image
   naming the git repo URLS from step 1. Once this works...
o) use [cyber-dojo up --starter=IMAGE_NAME]


Use LABEL org.cyber-dojo.start-point=true in build-cd-script
to reimplement
[cyber-dojo start-point ls]
and to find and show the images (instead of the labels).
Similarly, reimplement
[cyber-dojo start-point inspect NAME]
to show lots of meta-data for NAME, specifically all the
git-repo-url/sha/display_names info.
Show this in json format. Get info from X_shas.txt created by script.
X=custom/exercises/languages
Info unit == URL+SHA + [display_name...] How to get the array?

Once a start-point is an image, it could be just a local image.
It might not be in any repository (such as dockerhub).
Is this a problem? Does it ever need to do a [docker pull]?
I'm presuming that for a minikube'd server there is no scaling...?

Make visible_filenames a required key in exercise's manifest.json
It must not be allowed to contain a file called cyber-dojo.sh
Update start-points-exercises repo accordingly (done)
This is not a breaking change since commander's [up] can now
take a [--starter=IMAGE_NAME] option.
So using volumes, exercise manifest.json files are ignored.
Using images, exercise manifest.json files are required.


SPB will need to have a bit of new functionality to
pick one file from the exercise's manifest.json visible_filenames
which it returns to web when web is showing the exercises name+content.
Algorithm.
if there is a file called instructions use that.
if there is a file called readme.txt use that.
otherwise use the biggest file.

--------------------------
LATER
--------------------------

Refactor web and saver so web passes saver the
display_name and exercise_name and saver gets the manifest.json
file from SPB. SPB will merge the visible_files from both manifests.
THIS IS A BREAKING CHANGE FOR commander because we will be
changing the behaviour of web. Do later. Once commander is switched.

Aside: add standard LABELs to cyber-dojo images. eg cyberdojo/differ
LABEL org.cyber-dojo.vcs-ref=SHA
LABEL org.cyber-dojo.vcs-url=URL
See https://label-schema.org

Aside: add a magic-numbers button on the footer that takes you to the sha/index page.
